This repository contains the necessary files for designing and developing ROMR (A ROS-based Open-source Mobile Robot). ROMR utilizes off-the-shelf (OTS) components, additive manufacturing technologies, aluminium profiles, and a consumer hoverboard with high-torque brushless direct current (BLDC) motors. ROMR is fully compatible with the robot operating system (ROS), has a maximum payload of 90kg, and costs less than $1500. Furthermore, ROMR offers a simple yet robust framework for contextualizing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, an essential prerequisite for autonomous robot navigation.

Detailed instructions for the robot design and development can be found in [this publication](https://cloud.cps.unileoben.ac.at/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/HardwareX_Manuscript&openfile=653870).
